                    <p>How far are you willing to go for science?</p>
                    <p>Welcome to the department. You'll be managing a team of scientists, each a specialist in their own field. This is a highly classified testing environment, so your interaction with the outside world will be limited.</p>
                    <p>Don't let your team step out of line! Keep an eye on their:
                    <ul>
                    <li>Happiness: Increase chances for random grants and other special events.</li>
                    <li>Productivity: Work at a steady pace and gradually earn free time.</li>
                    <li>Economy: Stretch the budget and spend less for everyday items.</li>
                    </ul></p>
                    <p>What, you'd like to actually meet these people? Do that on your own time - this isn't social hour!</p>
                    <p>Click that <strong>Conduct Research</strong> button and get to work!</p>
