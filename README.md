From Wikipedia:
>"Incremental games, also called idle games, clicker games or clicking games, are video games whose gameplay consists of the player performing simple actions (such as clicking on the screen) repeatedly to gain currency. This can be used to obtain items or abilities that increase the rate at which currency accrues."

For Science! is built entirely with Javascript, Angular.js, HTML, and CSS. This is the third iteration of the game, built as an exercise in Angular.js.
